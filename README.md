# What is it ?

Leefmail is both a smtp mail server and a webmail. Only one tool to install, only one tool to master.

Mail servers are difficult to install and configure because they can do a lot of things 
that are unnecessary for most end users. We also need to connect things like:
  
- a spam filter,
- a webmail.


With Leefmail, you install only one tool for everything.
Functionality is simple:

- Receiving mail for a family or small business
- Access your mail anywhere with integrated webmail
- Create a mailing list on the go
 

You no longer need to search for the last email of your recipient sent six months earlier.

Advantages:

- Easy backup: you only have one directory to save.
- Easy configuration
- For small groups like famillies or smal compagnies
